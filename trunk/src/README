liveplayer wants to become a dj playing software, but it is very new project.

For the moment it is a small (and bugged..) command-line software, because I try to implement the audio_device before make the GUI...

Install: some libraries must be installed bofore this software can be compiled:

- libasound, libasound-dev
- libsndfile, libsndfile-dev
- libsamplerate, libsamplerate-dev
- Others ?

PS: read the usage section befor continue:
when Ok, in the liveplayer directory type (qmake is very nice !):
qmake
make

You should find the binary in the bin/ directory.

Usage:
- must edit LP_global_var.cpp :
	- define nb_channel (depend of your soundcard)
	- if you have 2 channels soundcard, edit liveplayer.cpp and set player_2->mbus = 1;
then, in the bin/ directory:
./liveplayer file1 file2   (depending of number of player configured in the LP_global_var.cpp file) 

It's realy a very BETA software, I hope just it can play somthing with your system.. 

Features:
- plays linear audiofile, like wav, aiff, etc.... (thank you sndfile ! ;) )
- hmm... playing 2 files ...
- options ? sorry, just the input files can be passed for the moment (configs need editing, recompiling -> BAD, I now :) )
- Nothing else :(

Planed:
- get the resampling working (have problem to implement proper resampling, see LP_audiofile.cpp, try to change factor to hear result)
- eliminate bugs....
- initialise the players automatically (for the moment you must edit liveplayer.cpp and LP_global_var.cpp for the moment)
- put the LADSPA
- build a GUI
- database system (find files to play so fast as possible - this is futur... I hope)
- extern command console (how play somethings live else ?), but... could I make somthing before 2015 ? :)
- more ? (for moment I hope just play somthing with a GUI, can change speed, filters, volume in real time)

Something else ?
Yes: Have a nice life ! :)
